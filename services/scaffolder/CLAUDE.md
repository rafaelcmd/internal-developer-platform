.NET service that owns the **repository domain** of the platform: given an
application request, it creates a GitHub repository, renders a golden-path
template into it, wires up CI/CD, and records what it built. It runs as a
long-lived container on EKS Fargate, consuming task tokens from the scaffold
state machine.

Target framework: **.NET 10 (LTS)**. Dev box toolchain: .NET SDK 10.0.111,
Docker 29.7.2. On Ubuntu 24.04 the SDK comes straight from the distro archive
(`sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-10.0`); no Microsoft package repo is needed.

## Why this service is a container

It was originally Lambda functions deployed with AWS SAM.
[ADR-0004](../../docs/adr/0004-scaffolder-runs-as-a-container-on-eks.md) records
why that changed; the short version:

1. The OTel Collector runs **in-cluster**, and Lambda cannot reach it without
   being VPC-attached. Off-cluster, a scaffold request's trace fragmented across
   two backends — Datadog for API → SQS → provisioner, X-Ray for the seven steps
   that do the actual work.
2. On **Fargate** every pod is its own microVM, so the "keep it off the cluster
   so a GitHub outage cannot eat pod capacity" argument does not apply.
3. The Infra Worker is already a container consuming `.waitForTaskToken`
   messages, so that plumbing exists regardless.

**IaC boundary: there isn't one any more.** Terraform owns every AWS resource
this service uses, in `infra/live/scaffolder/dev`. Kubernetes owns the workload,
in `k8s/scaffolder/`. Do not reintroduce SAM or CloudFormation —
`DependencyRuleTests.Nothing_references_the_lambda_runtime` fails the build if
an `Amazon.Lambda.*` package comes back.

```

Every scaffolder state is a `.waitForTaskToken` task: Step Functions puts a
message on a queue carrying the task name, the payload and the callback token,
and the worker dispatches on the name.

Of those, the deployed definition contains `ReserveName`, `CreateRepository` and
`ProvisionInfra` (the last a `Fail` state until the infra worker exists), plus
the DynamoDB writes that record terminal request state. The rest of the diagram
is still intent. See
[ADR-0006](../../docs/adr/0006-step-functions-as-provisioning-orchestrator.md)
for the orchestration decision and `infra/live/provisioner/dev/README.md` for
the definition as it stands.

There are **two** Deployments of the one image, and a queue each:

| Deployment | Queue | Tasks | Can read the App key |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scaffolder-state` | `...-scaffolder-state-tasks-dev` | `ReserveName` | no |
| `scaffolder-github` | `...-scaffolder-github-tasks-dev` | `CreateRepository` | yes |

The split is a security boundary, not a scaling one — see **Security** below. It
decides where a new task goes: anything that only touches this service's own
table belongs on the state worker, anything that talks to GitHub belongs on the
github worker. Adding one is a use case, an `IScaffoldTask` registration in
`Program.cs`, and its name in that Deployment's `SCAFFOLDER_TASKS` — never a
third Deployment unless it needs a third set of credentials.

`CreateRepository` and `ProvisionInfra` can run in parallel — creating a repo
does not depend on infrastructure existing. Only `InjectInfraOutputs` needs both,
so it is the join. Keep it that way: serializing them makes a developer wait for
a multi-minute Terraform run before they can see their repository, and "time to
first commit" is the metric this platform is judged on.

What crosses that join is deliberately thin.
[ADR-0007](../../docs/adr/0007-infrastructure-outputs-reach-applications-by-reference.md)
has scaffolded applications resolve their queue, their database and everything
else by **SSM parameter path** rather than by values written into the
repository: the path is derivable from the request
(`/idp/<application>/<environment>/<resource>/<output>`), so a template renders
against the contract before Terraform has provisioned anything. `InjectInfraOutputs`
is therefore a **verification** step — every parameter the template expects
exists and is readable — not a config rewrite. Anything that genuinely cannot be
a convention arrives later as a pull request against the new repository, so it
never blocks first commit. A credential never crosses the join at all: the
parameter holds a Secrets Manager ARN and the application's IRSA role is what
reads it.

**Ownership boundary.** The provisioner owns saga/request state. This service
owns templates, name reservations, and the repository inventory, in its own
DynamoDB table. Neither service reads the other's table — they communicate only
through the state machine's input/output.

## Layout

```
src/
  Scaffolder.Domain/          - entities, value objects, port interfaces; no refs at all
  Scaffolder.Application/     - one use case per state machine task
  Scaffolder.Infrastructure/  - adapters: GitHub, DynamoDB, S3, Secrets Manager
  Scaffolder.Worker/          - entry point: host, task queue consumer, dispatcher
tests/
  Scaffolder.UnitTests/       - xUnit, domain + application + dispatcher wiring
  Scaffolder.IntegrationTests/- adapters against LocalStack / a test GitHub org
templates/                    - golden paths (dotnet-api, then consumer and console)
events/                       - task-envelope fixtures for `make seed`
local/                        - LocalStack init script; creates the table and both queues
Directory.Build.props         - TFM, nullable, langversion, warnings-as-errors
Directory.Packages.props      - every package version, pinned centrally
Scaffolder.slnx               - the .NET 10 SDK's XML solution format, not .sln
Dockerfile.dev                - multi-stage build; runtime image, non-root
docker-compose.dev.yaml       - the worker plus LocalStack; included by the root compose
Makefile
```

Infrastructure lives outside this directory, with everything else of its kind:
`infra/live/scaffolder/dev` (table, both task queues, the App key secret and its
KMS key, both IRSA roles) and `k8s/scaffolder` (both Deployments).

Dependency rule mirrors the Go API's hexagonal layout: `Domain` depends on
nothing, `Application` depends on domain ports, `Infrastructure` implements them,
`Worker` is composition + serialization only. Business logic must not live in the
worker — it deserializes, calls a use case, serializes the result, so the same
logic is testable without a queue. Swapping Lambda for a container touched only
`Scaffolder.Worker`, which is the layering paying for itself.

This is not an honour system:
`tests/Scaffolder.UnitTests/Architecture/DependencyRuleTests.cs` parses the
project files and fails the build if a layer grows a reference it should not
have, if a package version is declared outside `Directory.Packages.props`, if the
queue and hosting packages escape `Scaffolder.Worker`, or if Octokit escapes
`Scaffolder.Infrastructure`.

## How the worker runs a task

`TaskQueueWorker` is a `BackgroundService`. At startup it resolves the queue
**name** to a URL — so no account id lands in the committed manifest — then long
polls it for 20s at a time.

The **deletion rule** is the thing to understand before changing it: a message is
deleted only once its outcome has reached Step Functions, by `SendTaskSuccess` or
`SendTaskFailure`. Everything else — an unparseable body, a missing token, a
transient AWS fault — is left on the queue, so SQS redelivers it and the DLQ
catches it after `maxReceiveCount`. Deleting on failure would strand the
execution until its task timeout with nothing to look at.

Error names are ours now. On Lambda the `Catch` clause had to match whatever the
runtime reported (the short exception type name). The worker chooses, so it sends
the domain's own `ScaffolderException.Code` — a stable contract that survives
renaming a class.

Reporting a failure has to survive failing. `SendTaskFailure` is called from
inside a `catch`, and an exception thrown there is **not** caught by that `try`'s
other clauses — it escapes `ExecuteAsync` and stops the host. One expired task
token was enough to crash-loop the pod. `FailAsync` now handles its own errors
and leaves the message for redelivery; `TaskQueueWorkerTests` is the regression.

**Which failures are domain failures.** A `ScaffolderException` is reported to
the state machine and the message is deleted. Everything else — a GitHub 5xx, a
rate limit, an expired installation token, a DynamoDB blip — is left to
propagate, so the message redelivers. That distinction is why
`OctokitRepositoryHost` translates only "already exists" and "not found": turning
a transient fault into a domain error would report a permanent failure for
something that would have worked thirty seconds later.

Configuration is read and validated in `Program.cs` before the host starts, so a
missing table name is a CrashLoopBackOff at startup rather than a null reference
on the first task.

## DynamoDB (single table)

One table, owned entirely by this service, created by
`infra/live/scaffolder/dev`.

| Item | PK | SK | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Template version | `TEMPLATE#<name>` | `VERSION#<semver>` | S3 bundle key, checksum, parameter schema |
| Name reservation | `NAME#<app-name>` | `RESERVATION` | request id, status, TTL |
| Repository record | `REPO#<owner>/<name>` | `META` | source template + version, request id, created_at |

- **GSI1** (`template#version` → repos) answers *"which repositories are behind
  the current template version?"* — the day-2 drift question that separates a
  real scaffolder from a demo. Not created yet; design for it now.
- **Name reservation is a conditional write**
  (`attribute_not_exists(PK) OR RequestId = :requestId`), which makes uniqueness
  a single atomic operation instead of a read-then-write race.
- **Every state transition is a conditional write** on the expected current
  status. Step Functions retries and at-least-once SQS delivery mean tasks *will*
  run more than once for the same input; conditional writes make the duplicate a
  no-op instead of a second repository. This is also what gates scaling the
  Deployment past one replica.
- **TTL** on `ExpiresAt` (epoch seconds) so abandoned requests release their name
  automatically.

## Templates

Source of truth is `templates/` in this repo. CI packages each directory into a
versioned bundle and uploads it to the S3 template bucket (versioning enabled);
DynamoDB records the version and checksum. The worker never reads `templates/`
from the repo — always from S3 by version, so a scaffold is reproducible.

A template is not just `dotnet new` output. Each one carries the things that make
a service production-shaped on day zero:

- service code in the platform's layout
- configuration that resolves provisioned resources by SSM parameter path at
  startup, never by an injected literal (ADR-0007), with the resolution already
  wired up so an application author never writes it
- OTel SDK pre-wired to the Collector, with `service.name` / `service.version` /
  `deployment.environment` set the same way the Go services set them
- health and readiness endpoints, graceful shutdown, structured JSON logging
- `Dockerfile` and `k8s/deployment.yaml` matching the existing manifests
- CI/CD workflows following the repo's `ci-` / `cd-` / `ops-` naming convention
- `CLAUDE.md`, README, and a `docs/adr/` directory
- Terraform stub for the service's own resources (IRSA role, ECR repo)
- catalog registration metadata (owner, team, on-call, tier)

## Configuration

Env vars, set by `k8s/scaffolder/deployment.yaml`. No config file.

- `SCAFFOLDER_TABLE_NAME` (required)
- `SCAFFOLDER_TASK_QUEUE_NAME` (required) — the **name**, not the URL. The worker
  calls `GetQueueUrl` at startup, which keeps the account id out of git and lets
  the same manifest run in any account
- `SCAFFOLDER_RESERVATION_TTL_MINUTES` — how long an unfinished scaffold holds a
  name before TTL releases it. Defaults to 360 (6 hours): long enough to outlive
  a slow Terraform run, short enough that an abandoned request frees the name the
  same day
- `TEMPLATE_BUCKET` — not wired yet
- `SCAFFOLDER_TASKS` — comma-separated allowlist of the tasks this pod serves
  (`ReserveName` on the state worker, `CreateRepository` on the github worker).
  Unset means every task the binary knows about **that is configured** — GitHub
  tasks are skipped rather than fatal when `GITHUB_ORG` is absent, which is what
  keeps a bare `dotnet run` and the local container working without an App key.
  Naming `CreateRepository` explicitly without `GITHUB_ORG` is a startup error
- `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_ORG` — in dev these are `4608314` and the sandbox org
  `idp-scaffolder-sandbox`. The sandbox exists to be filled with disposable
  repositories; never point dev at a real org
- `GITHUB_APP_KEY_SECRET_ARN` — Secrets Manager ARN for the GitHub App private
  key. Never a PAT, never an env var holding the key itself
- `ENVIRONMENT`, `SERVICE_VERSION`, `SERVICE_NAME`
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` — telemetry is a **no-op when unset**, matching
  the Go services, which is what keeps `dotnet run` on a laptop quiet

There is deliberately **no `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID`**. Resolve the installation at
runtime with `GET /orgs/{org}/installation` using the app JWT, then exchange it
for an installation token. One less config value, and it survives the app being
uninstalled and reinstalled — which changes the installation ID but not the App
ID.

Secrets are fetched once at startup and cached for the pod's lifetime — not per
task, which would add a Secrets Manager call to every request.

## Security

- **GitHub App, not a PAT.** Short-lived installation tokens, scoped to the org,
  revocable, and auditable per-repository.
- **Two Deployments, two roles.** On Lambda each function had its own role, so
  the handler that reserved a name could not read the GitHub App key. A pod is
  the smallest thing an IRSA role attaches to, so restoring that meant a second
  pod: `scaffolder-state` runs `ReserveName`, `scaffolder-github` runs
  `CreateRepository` and holds the only role with
  `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the App key. Both are declared by
  `local.workers` in `infra/live/scaffolder/dev`, which drives the queues, the
  roles and the ServiceAccounts together.
  **Do not widen the state role to reach the secret** — that deletes the whole
  property. Add the task to the github worker instead.
- **A queue each, and that is not optional.** Two Deployments polling one queue
  would each receive the other's tasks, so the role split would surface as random
  `AccessDenied` rather than as a boundary. `SCAFFOLDER_TASKS` names what a pod
  serves and the dispatcher refuses anything else, so a misrouted message fails
  where it is visible.
- **The pipeline can create the secret and cannot read it.** `policy_scaffolder.tf`
  carries an explicit `Deny` on `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` and
  `PutSecretValue`. The PEM is put in by hand, so it never passes through a plan,
  a state file or a workflow log.
- **KMS** for the template bucket and the secret. Customer-managed key so key
  policy and rotation are explicit.

## Deployment

`cd-scaffolder.yml`, following `cd-provisioner.yml` exactly: build the image,
push it to the shared ECR repository as `scaffolder-<sha>`, pin that tag into the
manifest, `kubectl apply`, wait for the rollout. Uses the existing
`aws-oidc-login` composite — no long-lived AWS keys.

Terraform first: the `scaffolder` component owns the ServiceAccount the pod binds
to, so a deploy against a fresh cluster fails without it. `ops-platform-up.yml`
encodes that ordering.

There is no automatic rollback on alarm. That is what Lambda's
`DeploymentPreference: Canary10Percent5Minutes` gave for free and a Kubernetes
rolling update does not — a known cost of ADR-0004, not an oversight.

## Observability

Identical to the Go services, which is the point:

- OTLP over gRPC to `otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317`, which
  forwards to Datadog. `service.name` / `service.version` /
  `deployment.environment` are set from the same env vars the Go services use, so
  a scaffold shows up as part of the request that triggered it rather than as an
  orphan trace.
- The worker's spans do **not** join the trace the API opened. Step Functions
  traces with X-Ray and injects no W3C `traceparent`, and `TaskEnvelope` carries
  no trace-context field, so a scaffold currently reads as its own trace rooted
  at the worker. Closing that means putting the API's `traceparent` into the
  execution input and threading it through the envelope; until then the
  correlation between a request and its scaffold is the request id, not the
  trace id.
- `AddAWSInstrumentation()` puts SDK calls on the trace, so a slow DynamoDB write
  reads as its own span rather than unexplained time inside a task.
- Runtime metrics via `AddRuntimeInstrumentation()`, over the same OTLP pipe. No
  separate metrics path.
- Enable X-Ray active tracing on the state machine when it exists — the execution
  graph with timings is the fastest way to see which step is slow.

## Testing

- `dotnet test` — xUnit. Domain and application layers test with no AWS.
- Adapters test against LocalStack (DynamoDB, S3, Secrets Manager) and a
  throwaway GitHub org.
- `make up && make seed` for a hand check against LocalStack. Note what that does
  **not** cover: the fixture's task token is fake, so everything up to the
  callback runs for real and `SendTaskSuccess` is then rejected — see
  `events/README.md`.
- The **GitHub adapter is the one part no local stub can prove.** The JWT, the
  installation lookup and the token exchange fail in ways only GitHub can tell
  you about, so `CreateRepositoryIntegrationTests` runs against the sandbox org
  for real, creating and deleting a throwaway repository. It is gated on
  `SCAFFOLDER_INTEGRATION=1` **and** `GITHUB_ORG` being set; xUnit 2 has no
  runtime skip, so the gate is an early return.
- The compensation path (`Compensate`) needs tests as much as the happy path. It
  runs rarely, which is exactly why it rots — assert that a failed scaffold
  leaves no repository and no reservation behind.

## Commands

`make` from this directory lists the targets. The common ones:

```bash
make build                        # dotnet build
make test                         # unit tests: no AWS, no Docker, no network
make test-integration             # adapters against LocalStack + the sandbox org (opt-in)
make format-check                 # dotnet format --verify-no-changes
make up                           # worker + LocalStack via docker compose
make seed E=events/reserve-name.json                # one task on the state queue
make seed W=github E=events/create-repository.json   # ... on the github queue
make logs                         # follow the worker
```

Integration tests are opt-in via `SCAFFOLDER_INTEGRATION=1` because they need
Docker and credentials; without it they return immediately rather than fail. The
GitHub ones additionally need `GITHUB_ORG`, `GITHUB_APP_ID` and
`GITHUB_APP_KEY_SECRET_ARN`, and AWS credentials that can read that secret.

Three things that are easy to lose time to:

- **`Amazon.StepFunctions` also defines a `LogLevel`.** It collides with
  `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel` in any file that uses both;
  `Program.cs` carries a `using` alias for it.
- **The AWS SDK for .NET v4 leaves response collections null, not empty.**
  `ReceiveMessageResponse.Messages` is `null` when a long poll times out, which
  is the common case. `TaskQueueWorker` coalesces it; anything new reading an SDK
  collection must do the same.
- **A GitHub App private key pasted through JSON or a shell arrives with literal
  `\n` instead of newlines**, and `RSA.ImportFromPem` then fails with an error
  that says nothing about why. `GitHubAppClientFactory` normalises it and rejects
  anything without a `-----BEGIN` header up front, so the message names the
  actual problem.
